Dependencies
- Python 3.10.2. Other python versions might work but have not been tested.
- All required packets are in the requirements.txt
- Run setup.py to set up any additional dependencies. P.S. Instead of downloading the notes via the setup.py, you can download the [input folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dyTLTZEUYfk57huIfTOyHlUBbYFb62Tn?usp=share_link) manually and replace the input folder in the root directory of the nback project.
- Qt6 must be installed in order for the GUI to appear.

See the other md files for installing from source.
